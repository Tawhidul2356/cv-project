                         Some of the most obvious examples of personal information include someone's name,
                          mailing address, email address, phone number, and medical records (if they can be used to 
                          identify the person). In addition, some privacy frameworks consider anything that can help
                           determine someone's identity, such as online identifiers or Internet browsing history,
                            to be personal information.

                       Internet technology has made personal data collection more widespread than ever before.
                      Today, personal information is stored in a variety of places. For instance, web applications,
                       social media platforms, ad networks, employers, or healthcare providers
                        all might have data about a given person stored in digital form on servers all over the world.
                         This has important implications for data privacy, as people may have less control 
                         over who can see their personal information than they want.

                       here are several legal definitions of "personal information" and "personal data"
                        under various types of privacy legislation. This article includes definitions from the GDPR and
                         the CCPA, which are two crucial pieces of modern-day privacy legislation especially
                          for businesses that operate in the US and the EU. However, regulations in countries around 
                          the world have their own definitions.</p>
